"Look Closer" is Ninjadev's entry for TRSAC 2018.  It is a single-file compiled web demo. To run it, simply open the .png.html file in your favorite modern, performant mp3-supporting browser (such as Chrome). *Remember --allow-file-access-from-files if running from disk!*

This demo is made using our open-source in-browser demo tool called nin. Both the demo and the tool are open source, find them both at http://github.com/ninjadev. Thanks to everyone at TRSAC 2018 for throwing yet another awesome party!

"Look Closer" was made by lulle, profit, sigveseb and stiaje.
